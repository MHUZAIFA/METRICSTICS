## Introduction

METRICSTICS helps in calculating descriptive statistics.

The purpose of descriptive statistics is to quantitatively describe a collection of data by measures of central tendency, measures of frequency, and measures of variability.

Let x be a random variable that can take values from a finite data set x1, x2, x3, ..., xn, with each value having the same probability.

1. The minimum, m, is the smallest of the values in the given data set. (m need not be unique.)

2. The maximum, M, is the largest of the values in the given data set. (M need not be unique.)

3. The mode, o, is the value that appears most frequently in the given data set. (o need not be unique.)

4. The median, d, is the middle number if n is odd, and is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers if n is even.

5. Mean (Î¼):
   Î¼ = (1/n) * Î£(xi), where i ranges from 1 to n.

6. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):
   MAD = (1/n) * Î£ |xi - Î¼|, where i ranges from 1 to n.

7. Standard Deviation (Ïƒ):
   Ïƒ = sqrt((1/n) * Î£(xi - Î¼)^2), where i ranges from 1 to n.


## Features

- Calculate statistics: min, max, mean, median, mode, mad, and standard deviation.
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.
- A sleek dark theme for a modern and comfortable user experience.
- Input data through keyboard, file upload, or the interactive randomizer button.
- Convenient session management â€“ store and load your statistical sessions effortlessly.
- Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for a clean and modular code structure.
